# csscss for Sass & Compass

Easily integrate Zach Moazeni's [csscss](http://zmoazeni.github.io/csscss/) into your projects that use the Compass CSS Framework by providing a `compass csscss` command line option.

## Installation

Assuming ruby is installed on your system:

    $ gem install compass-csscss

Note that this requires at least version 1.0.0.alpha.13 of [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) to work properly.

## Usage

Run the following command from the root of your Compass project:

    $ compass csscss

To view options:

    $ compass csscss --help
